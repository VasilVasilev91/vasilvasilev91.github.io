                                <h2>Belarus suspends 'social parasite' tax</br></br></h2>
<p>Belarus's president has suspended the collection of a tax on people not in full-time employment - the so-called decree "against social parasites".</br></br>
Alexander Lukashenko said those who worked fewer than 183 days per year would not be liable in 2017 - but stressed the tax would not be scrapped.</br></br>
The decree - adopted in 2015 - requires those people to pay about $250 (£205) as compensation for lost tax revenues.</br></br>
It triggered mass protests last month, and more rallies are planned for March.</br></br>
Mr Lukashenko announced the decision to freeze the tax collection at a government meeting in the capital Minsk on Thursday. Belarus's president has suspended the collection of a tax on people not in full-time employment - the so-called decree "against social parasites".</br></br>
