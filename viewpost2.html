                                <h2>Pakistan activist Waqass Goraya: The state tortured me</br></br></h2>
<p>A motorway bridge has collapsed near the north-east Italian city of Ancona, killing two, Italian officials say.</br></br>
The victims were in a car below the bridge when it fell down onto the A14 road, which runs between Loreto and Ancona South.</br></br>
The collapse involved a temporary structure which was supporting the bridge, Autostrade, the Italian highways agency said.</br></br>
Two Romanian workers were also injured, Italian media reported.</br>He described being punched, slapped and forced into stress positions during the three weeks he was held. He worried he would never be released.
"We knew it was overâ€¦ We will die under torture," he told the BBC.</br></br>
He also spoke at a side event at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva about his experiences.</br></br>
Mr Goraya believes he was detained because he ran a satirical Facebook page critical of the influence of the Pakistani military in the country's political system.</br></br>
The page has also criticised military policy in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province. Mr Goraya strongly denies breaking any laws.</br></br>
"I hadn't done anything criminal - otherwise I would've been in a court not in illegal detention," he told the BBC.</p>
